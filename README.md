# FacialKeyPointsRecognition
Kaggle Facial Key Points Recognition Competition 
The objective of the project is to determine the locations of key features on a face. 
The problem relates to the field of computer vision and deep learning.We aim to develop a model that predicts positions of 
15 key facial points - such as nose tip, centres and corners of eyes, mouth, lips, eyebrows, etc. - given images of faces,
assuming the images are head-shots of the person and are in gray-scale. 
For this project, R and Python was used. Python libraries include pandas, matplotlib, Theano and Lasagne.
While R libraries include ggplot, hmisc, IM.
